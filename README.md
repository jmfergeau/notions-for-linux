# Unofficial Notions app for Linux

I was sick of Windows and Mac having an app but not Linux so I decided to make my own one, using Electron. Fully opensource of course.

This is a very new project (originally for my personal use) with only the basics feature, since I'm not a Notions employee and am a newbie for Electron. So if you want to add more features and all, feel free to make pull requests !

# Commands
- `npm start` to test the program
- `npm run build` to build the Appimage
